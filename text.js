 const darkKnightRises = `You remember the scene in Dark Knight Rises when Bruce Wayne makes the leap out of [prison name] without a tether? Until that moment his tethered jumps had failed because, as his fellow prisoner explains, they provoked insufficient fear. The reduced risk weakened his motivation and his results.

 const myStoryIntersects = `My story intersects with this one. One day I was driving a garbage truck. The next day I had put in my notice. Two week later, I had started a four-month, full-time software development program. No job. No funding. Just my mother wit, my savings, my cat, and my mortgage. I was afraid and motivated.`;
 const calculatedRisk = `I had leapt and was now in midair. However, just as Bruce Wayne’s leap cannot be appreciated without context, neither can mine. Bruce Wayne’s leap was a risk, but it was a calculated one. In case my story could inspire someone to be reckless, please know that I did not decide on a software development program all at once with no background. I had a long stage of build-up and then a breakthrough.

 const myFirstCodingExperience = `My first coding experience was [calculate years via JS] years ago writing vlookups in Microsoft Excel. Then I began using index(match()), a formula nested inside another. Then I was building Excel workbooks for myself and my coworkers to automate tasks around the office. Each breakthrough produced a dizzying euphoria because it affirmed my suspicions that nearly anything was possible with a computer.`;
 const theAddictionGrew = `The addiction grew. Excel led me to Google Sheets, which led me to Google Apps Script, which led me to JavaScript. JS got me thinking about HTML and CSS. I watched countless hours of YouTube. Then I started buying courses. I spent hundreds on Udemy courses. I was learning, to be sure, but squeezing learning times in between a 50-hour-a-week job and all the other duties required to keep a person fed, clean, fueled, insured, sociable, and sane, my progress was at a snail’s pace.`;
 const soIleapt = `So after a solid year of working a job I hated and learning as much as I could on my own in the evenings, I was convinced I had enough savings and enough knowledge to take the leap.`
